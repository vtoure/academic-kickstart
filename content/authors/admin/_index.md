I am a Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics at NTNU, in Norway. Since 2015, I have gained experience in data standardization and knowledge management in the field of systems biology and molecular biology. At the same time, I've been interested in software tool development for biological data analysis, data visualization and data extraction. Currently, my research combine all these aspects for the study of causal statements in molecular biology.
In 2018, I became a member of the SBGN editorial board ([SBGN](https://sbgn.github.io/)).
